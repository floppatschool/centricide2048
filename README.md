# Centricide 2048
[Centricide 2048](https://floppatschool.github.io/centricide2048/) is a [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048/) clone made using [2048 Cupcakes](https://github.com/henry7720/2048-Cupcakes/) as a framework. The tiles are images of Centricide characters instead of numbers or cupcakes. The restart button placemet is wonky but everything works fine. Man I love the funny color guys.
